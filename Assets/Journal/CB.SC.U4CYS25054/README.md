Subject:The three people i met in my college,whom iam grateful too

Yuva teja: i'm very grateful for yuvaa. He is one of the most mischievous and chill people I have ever met. From the first day I knew him, I could tell that life around him would never be boring. He is always full of energy, jokes, and funny ideas. Sometimes he makes trouble just for fun, but his heart is always good. Even when he teases everyone, he knows how to make people smile again.
He is a total gaming guy. Whenever we play, he is cool and confident, no matter if he wins or loses. He always says, “No tension, bro,” and somehow that makes everything feel lighter. I really admire how he can stay calm and happy all the time. Even when things go wrong, he never gets angry. He just laughs and moves on. That attitude teaches me to stay positive too.
Yes, he can be naughty, and sometimes he acts like a playboy just for jokes, but that’s part of his fun nature. Behind all the mischief, he is a true friend who cares. He may not show it with big words, but when someone needs help, he is always there. He listens, supports, and makes everyone feel comfortable.
I have learned a lot from him  how to take life easy, how to enjoy small moments, and how to stay happy without stress. Every memory with him is full of laughter. He may not be serious most of the time, but his friendship is something I take seriously. I feel lucky to have a friend like him in my life.

Deepak:i'm very grateful for deepak. He is one of the most unique people I know. He’s naughty, funny, and always full of life, but at the same time, he cares a lot about his studies. Even though he always says “I will study seriously from tomorrow,” we both know tomorrow never comes . Still, I like how he always tries and never gives up.
He gets worried about marks and exams, but even when he’s stressed, he finds a way to make everyone laugh. He can turn any serious moment into a funny one just by sending a meme or cracking a joke. His humour is next level  simple but smart. No matter how dull the class is, he will find something to make it entertaining. Sometimes teachers get angry, but even they can’t stay mad at him for long.
He gets distracted easily, but that’s what makes him fun. One minute he’s studying, the next minute he’s watching memes or talking about random funny stuff. He always says “just five minutes break,” but that break becomes one hour. Still, that’s him  full of energy, full of chaos, and full of heart.
Even though he jokes a lot, he’s actually a caring and kind person inside. He listens when someone is upset, helps when someone needs notes, and always stands by his friends. He might act careless, but he has a good soul. I really respect that.
Life with him is never boring. Every day feels like an adventure with jokes, memes, and crazy moments. I’m grateful for all the fun times and the friendship we share.

Sandy:I want to talk about a friend who truly inspires me. He is one of the most well-studied and disciplined people I know. He always takes things seriously, listens carefully in class, and never misses his work. While some of us are lazy or distracted and enjoying college life, he stays focused and organized. He has a strong time sense  he knows when to study, when to relax, and how to manage everything perfectly.
He’s always early to class, always prepared, and never wastes time. He believes that every minute counts, and that’s something I really respect about him. His dedication pushes me to do better too. Even when the topic is difficult, he keeps trying until he understands it completely.
Before exams, he often gets scared and overthinks. He worries a lot, saying things like “I don’t think I’ll score well this time,” but he always ends up doing great. He writes neatly, studies deeply, and gets the best marks in the end. I think his nervousness shows how much he truly cares about his performance and learning.
He also has many good qualities  he’s polite, respectful, and humble. He never shows off his marks or knowledge. Instead, he helps others when they’re confused. If someone doesn’t understand a lesson, he patiently explains it. That makes him not only a good student, but also a great friend.
What I like most about him is his balance. He knows how to manage time, take responsibility, and still stay calm. He never wastes his potential and always motivates others to stay focused.
I’m really grateful to have him as a friend.
These are my best buddies in btech life
